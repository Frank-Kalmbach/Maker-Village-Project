        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <p>Obviously, this project is still in embrionic form. It has been gestating in my mind for the past several years, often as a vague feeling of unease over the direction in which the United States and the world are heading. My fondness of speculative fiction has done little to dampen this growing disquiet. On the positive side, I have been enormously uplifted by the growing slow-food, maker and buy-local movements. In my opinion, the rise of mass media (including social), a cheap fossil fuel economy, and a consumption-based society have fractured the traditional communities that have been the bedrock of our society for generations. This new local awareness offers a path back to sanity, if we are willing as a society to embrace it.</p>
        <p>If you are interesting in this project, please don't hesitate to contact me via the e-mail link below. I included the facebook link as an afterthought - I don't suggest using it to contact me, since I recently visited facebook and will probably not check back in for another six months or so.</p>
