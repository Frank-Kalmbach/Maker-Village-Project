        <h3>The Maker Village Commonwealth</h3>
        <ul class="project">
          <li><h4>What Skills Do You Really Have?</h4></li>
            <p class="bullets">So let's image that society starts to unravel. For example, there has been a coronal mass ejection from the sun on a scale similar to the 1859 Carrington Event.  NASA recently reported that the Earth just barely avoided such an event in July 2012, and the resulting electrical storm could have knocked out most of the transformers in our power grid. Replacement of these enormous transformers could have required years. So, in this case, no reliable electricty for the foreseeable future. Where would you go? What would you do? Let's say you have a friend in the countryside with some decent farmland. Could you grow your own food? Safety preserve the food? Raise chickens? Mill flour? Defend the property? Survive the winter? Do you and your friends have the knowledge and skills to survive in a 19th Century environment?</p>
          <li><h4>The Maker Village Commonwealth</h4></li>
            <p class="bullets">The core concept of the Maker Village is to create an knowledge and skill "seed bank" - a community of like-minded people already established in a town designed to take advantage of our current level of technology, but with the resources to boot-strap back up in case of a cascading failure of our current global civilization. The town would be built utilizing the best technologies we have today (green, efficient, connected, self-contained), but with redundancies to allow the community to carry-on, or even thrive, should the comforts that we take for granted today, disappear. The community model would be that of a commonwealth, recognized that every individual plays a vital role, and as such is valued both societally and economically. </p>
          <li><h4>The Brain Trust</h4></li>
          <p class="bullets">Who would make up this community? The tinkers and hackers frequently living on the fringes of modern society... people who have the skills, abilities and passion that are often found in the emerging maker movement. The town would need farmers who respect the agricultural traditions of the past, value the land and respect the soil; skilled carpenters, blacksmiths and masons; lumber and grain millers; weavers, tailors and cobblers; doctors, vets and teachers; musicians, librarians and artists; and countless others.</p>
          <li><h4>So, Nothing Happened?</h4></li>
            <p class="bullets">Let's say we succeed, build Maker Village, and bring all these skilled artisans together in a brand new town. Years pass, decades, and we've found that after all, we have muddled through all the perils that face modern society. That would be fantastic! The misery and mortality of a new Dark Ages would be hideous, resulting in the deaths of countless millions. The reality of a true collapse is almost unimaginable. But what would happen to the village? Quite simply, it would carry on. The concept is that of a societal and technological insurance policy. If designed properly, the commonwealth would be a beacon of localism and craftsmanship, prospering through agrotourism and the sale of real goods designed to last for a lifetime or more, not the cheap junk we seem to value today.</p>
